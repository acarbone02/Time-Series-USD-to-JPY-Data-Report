# PSTAT 174 Data Report
 This repo contains the final Time-Series Data Project for Spring 2023 Semester. The main goal of the project was to apply time-series concepts learned in class to real world data. For my case, I choose to examine the widely traded currency pair of USD to JPY, and tried to predict the exchange rate 12 months out.

# Project Description
 The USD to JPY currency trade is the third most popular exchange in the world. Although exchange rates are heavily influenced by real world events and respective government policies, the exchange is ultimately a time-series upon which we apply can apply concepts and models to. This project aims to fit two different types of time-series models, SARIMA and GARCH, to forecast twelve monthly points of the exchange rate.   

# Project Download
 Accessing the project's code requires R (4.3) and RStudio (IDE) to view. R can be downloaded from their homepage: https://cran.r-project.org/ and RStudio likewise: https://posit.co/. If you are viewing this on a device unable to run R, a pdf is also provided, organizing all findings in a research paper format. The code is included in the appendix of the pdf. The project's plots are also included in a separate folder labeled 'Plots' for better resolution/viewing.

 # Credits
  This was a solo project implemented by me. All time-series concepts and advisory came from Professor Tomoyuki Ichiba's Spring 2023, PSTAT 174 TIME SERIES course at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Thank you Professor for teaching a fun course and allowing me to produce a project on these concepts.
